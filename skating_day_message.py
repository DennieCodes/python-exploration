The International Skating Union (ISU) has declared that December 4 is World Ice Skating Day! Break out those skates and find a frozen lake, ice rink, or a large bucket of frozen water!

Normally, you wouldn't be so excited about this. However, the ISU has asked that you redo their Web site. One of the features on it is going to be a little message about National Ice Skating Day.

When it's December 4, you'll show a message that it's National Ice Skating Day!

When it's before December 4, you'll show a message that the holiday is in the future.

When it's after December 4, you'll show a little message about how someone can enjoy it next year.

You're getting paid some hefty Swiss Francs for this, so you want it to be good.
